### Simple projects as a learning experience to the creation of processes and threads.

> The first application displays its start time, launches the second (Win32Project2) via 5 seconds after its start and displays the Win32Project2 launch time. Before exiting, Win32Project1 displays the current time. Win32Project2 in a cycle with a 5-second interval displays the current time. The application completes its work via 10 seconds after the completion of the first process (if shut down Win32Project1). On completion of its work, Win32Project1 signals using an object of the event type. To count the time was used WaitableTimer. The current time is displayed to the nearest millisecond.
